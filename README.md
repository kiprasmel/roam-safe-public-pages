# roam-traverse-graph

traverse the graph, use/create plugins (simple js functions) to modify/react to the graph.

initial idea was to safely export selected pages and make them public, but then i realized one can add more functionality and start using roam for automation.

NB! current codebase very much a work-in-progress, many things will change, documentation is missing. create an issue if you want to work on something / suggest stuff.
