# roam-traverse-graph

traverse the graph, use/create plugins (simple js functions) to modify/react to the graph however you want, and optionally use it to create a new graph in roam.

initial idea was to safely export selected pages and mark them as public, but then i quickly realized one can add any functionality they want and start using roam for literally any automation.
